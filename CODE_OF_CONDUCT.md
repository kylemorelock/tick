# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone who contributes to or uses tick.

## Our standards

- **Be respectful.** Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Disagreement is fine; personal attacks are not.
- **Be constructive.** Focus on ideas and code, not on people. Give feedback that helps others improve.
- **Be inclusive.** We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels. Assume good intent.

## Unacceptable behavior

Harassment, trolling, discriminatory or offensive language, and other conduct that would make others feel unwelcome or unsafe are not acceptable.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove comments, close issues/PRs, or block users who violate these standards. For serious or repeated violations, we may take further action. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please contact the maintainers (e.g. via a private report or the repository’s Security/Advisory flow).
