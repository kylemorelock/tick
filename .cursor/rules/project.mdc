# Tick project context

- CLI entrypoint is `tick` (Typer + Rich) under `src/tick/cli`.
- Primary commands: `run`, `validate`, `report`, `init`, `templates`.
- Runs create session JSON files in `reports/session-<id>.json`.
- Reports support `html`, `json`, and `md/markdown` outputs.
- Checklists are YAML with a top-level `checklist` object.
- CLI errors should be clear and user-facing (`typer.Exit(code=1)` + Rich console).
- Prefer `Path` and explicit `utf-8` when reading/writing files.
- Keep docs aligned with real CLI options and schema behavior.
