# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in tick, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email the maintainers with a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any impact you believe it has. You can find maintainer contact in the [repository](https://github.com/kylemorelock/tick) or via GitHub’s “Security” tab → “Report a vulnerability.”
3. We will acknowledge your report and work with you to understand and address it.

We appreciate the effort to disclose findings responsibly and will credit you in any advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Supported versions

We provide security updates for the current major release. Please run a supported version if you rely on tick in production.
